Before starting:
Make sure to download PyTorch. Some models were switched to the PyTorch framework instead of Scikit Learn because it is a widely used research framework that excels with larger data and is ideal for research and prototyping.

Comments on LSTM Model:

Comments on Linear Regression Model:
At bottom of ipynb notebook

Comments on NN model:
the model is might be overfitting, maybe add regularization, validation loss not improving?

Future ToDos:
Make a GitHub Repo
Figure out what to do with Thermal Conductivity
Write code to scrape and download all sheets at once from a Google spreadsheet
Switch over to using the formatted data from the data group once more data is provided
Write code to calculate/plot the overall accuracy.
Add RNN Model
Although properties are constant across tests, eventually they won't be, so we should add them in
one-hot encode the categorical properties
